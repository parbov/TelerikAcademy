### History
My name is Serban Ghita and I'm a web developer and a former professional chess player. I love chess and I like to play on Chess.com
I wanted to create my own chess board so I can discuss chess positions on my blog.
This was also an excuse to attemp and create a chess board that works on both classic and mobile devices.
